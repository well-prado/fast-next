# Fast Next

Fast Next is the experimental fusion of Fastify 5, Next.js 16, and a CLI-first DX inspired by Igniter.js. Define routes once with Zod, consume them anywhere (HTTP, server caller, React hooks), and let the CLI scaffold every moving part.

## Why Fast Next?

- **Single source of truth** – A route definition feeds Fastify, the server caller, and the browser client.
- **Feature-based workflow** – Schemas, services, and routes live together under `apps/web/src/server`.
- **Automation-first** – The `create-fast-next` CLI recreates the exact wiring (routes, API catch-all, queues, cache, MCP, Docker, ORM, etc.).

## Major Building Blocks

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@fast-next/fastify-next-adapter` | Routes `NextRequest` through `fastify.inject`, preserving headers/body semantics. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-app-factory` | Memoized Fastify instance with plugin hooks + HMR-safe resets. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-zod-router` | Fluent router with literal resource/operation metadata + JSON Schema output. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-router` | Thin helpers for `createRoute` / `registerRoutes` and type utilities. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-server-caller` | Executes handlers without HTTP and powers the `api.*.query` helpers. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-server-client` | Auto-generates `api.resource.operation.query|mutate` helpers from route metadata. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-query-client` | Shared cache + invalidation layer for server and browser clients. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-browser-client` | Fetch + hook generator (`useQuery` / `useMutation`) mirroring TanStack Query. |
