# Fast Next Documentation

Welcome to the living docs for the Fastify + Next.js integration that powers the `apps/web` project. This guide mirrors the depth of the Igniter.js docs while focusing entirely on the vertical slice that already works in this repository.

## Why This Exists

- **Single source of truth** – Define routes once with Zod and reuse them everywhere.
- **Three consumption modes** – HTTP via Next.js, typed server caller, and (soon) generated clients.
- **Feature-oriented workflow** – Colocate schemas, handlers, and services inside `apps/web/src/server`.

The goal is to help you (and your future self) ship new features quickly without re-learning conventions or spelunking through framework code.

## Core Packages

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@fast-next/fastify-next-adapter` | Translates `NextRequest` → `fastify.inject` and back, handling headers, binary payloads, and base-path stripping. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-app-factory` | Lazily builds a singleton Fastify instance with plugin hooks and dev-safe HMR resets. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-zod-router` | Fluent router builder that stores method/path/schema metadata and emits Fastify JSON Schema. |
| `@fast-next/fastify-server-caller` | Creates a typed `caller(method, path, options)` helper that executes handlers without HTTP. |

These packages live in `packages/*` and are wired into `apps/web`.

## Who This Doc Is For

- Anyone adding a new feature under `apps/web`.
- Teammates (human or AI) who need to understand the architecture quickly.
- Future automation (CLIs, generators) that will rely on the documented conventions.
