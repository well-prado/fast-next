# Quickstart

Follow this checklist to get the Fast Next stack running locally and understand the moving parts before building your first feature.

## 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

> pnpm 9+ is required. Node 18.18+ recommended (Next 16 + Fastify 5 support).

## 2. Run the web app

```bash
pnpm --filter web dev
```

This boots Next.js on `http://localhost:3000` and mounts the Fastify instance behind the `/api/*` catch-all route.

## 3. Smoke test the HTTP path

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users/1
```

Both responses come from Fastify handlers defined in `apps/web/src/server/routes/index.ts`.

## 4. Inspect the server client demo

Open `apps/web/app/page.tsx`. The default home page is an **async Server Component** that fetches a featured user via:

```ts
const result = await api.get.user.query({
  params: { id: "1" },
});

// Or use the query client helper when batching/memoizing
await queryClient.fetchQuery("users", "get", { params: { id: "1" } });
```

Because this runs inside the same process there is no HTTP overhead, yet the response types match the Zod schemas thanks to the typed server caller + auto-generated helpers.

## 5. Run type and lint pipelines

```bash
pnpm --filter @fast-next/fastify-zod-router check-types
pnpm --filter @fast-next/fastify-server-caller check-types
pnpm --filter web check-types
pnpm lint
```

These commands ensure every package stays type-safe while you iterate.

With the basics working you’re ready to explore the architecture and build your own feature. Continue with the next sections for deeper dives.
