# Introduction

> The first AI-native TypeScript framework with built-in training for 15+ Code Agents. Built for Code Agents, perfected for developers.
> URL: https://igniterjs.com/docs/core

Igniter.js is **the first AI-native TypeScript framework** designed from the ground up for the future of software development—where humans and AI collaborate seamlessly. It provides end-to-end type safety, real-time capabilities, background jobs, and a predictable architecture that both developers and AI agents can easily understand and modify.

## Built for Code Agents, Perfected for Developers

Unlike traditional frameworks that treat AI integration as an afterthought, Igniter.js was architected from day one with **AI-first principles**. Every design decision—from the feature-sliced architecture to the explicit type system—creates a **low-entropy environment** that makes it dramatically easier for Code Agents like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI to understand, navigate, and modify your codebase.

The framework eliminates common sources of confusion for AI agents: implicit behaviors, magic conventions, scattered configuration, and complex inheritance hierarchies. Instead, it embraces **explicit over implicit**, **composition over inheritance**, and **feature-based organization** that mirrors how humans naturally think about business logic.

What does this mean in practice? When you ask Claude Code to "add authentication to the users endpoint," it doesn't need to hunt through multiple files, decipher framework magic, or guess at conventions. It sees a clear, predictable structure where every feature is self-contained, every dependency is explicit, and every type is precisely defined. The AI can confidently make changes knowing exactly what will break and what won't.

But being AI-native doesn't mean sacrificing developer experience. In fact, the same principles that make code easy for AI to understand—clarity, explicitness, and strong typing—make it a joy for humans to work with too. You get exceptional IntelliSense, instant error detection, and a framework that guides you toward best practices naturally.

```typescript
// Crystal-clear structure that both humans and AI understand instantly
export const users = igniter.controller({
  name: "Users",
  description: "Manage user accounts and profiles",
  path: "/users",
  actions: {
    getById: igniter.query({
      name: "Get User by ID",
      description: "Retrieve a specific user by their ID",
      path: "/:id" as const,
      handler: async ({ params }) => {
        const user = await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id: params.id } });
        return response.success({ user });
      },
    }),
  },
});

// Client code is automatically type-safe—no configuration needed
const { user } = await api.users.getById.query({ id: "123" });
//     ^? User - TypeScript knows the exact type!
```

## Why Igniter.js?

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="AI-Native Architecture">
    Built from the ground up for Code Agents with a low-entropy, predictable structure. Every file, every pattern, every convention is designed to be instantly understandable by both humans and AI.

    **What makes it AI-friendly?**

    * **Feature-Sliced Architecture** - Business logic organized by features, not technical layers
    * **Explicit Type System** - Zero magic, everything is typed and traceable
    * **Self-Contained Modules** - Each feature includes its routes, controllers, and types
    * **Predictable Patterns** - Consistent conventions across the entire codebase
    * **Low Coupling** - Changes are localized and AI can reason about impact

    When you ask Cursor to "add rate limiting to the auth endpoint," it knows exactly where to look, what to modify, and what tests to update—no guessing required.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="End-to-End Type Safety">
    Every request and response is fully typed from server to client. No code generation, no manual type definitions, no runtime overhead—just pure TypeScript inference.

    ```typescript
    // Change the server response
    return response.success({ user, posts }) // Added posts!

    // TypeScript immediately updates the client
    const data = await api.users.getById.query({ id: '123' })
    //    ^? { user: User, posts: Post[] } ✅
    ```

    If you change an endpoint's return type, add a parameter, or modify validation rules, TypeScript catches breaking changes instantly across your entire codebase. Your IDE becomes a safety net that prevents runtime errors before they happen.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Framework Agnostic">
    Built on Web Standards (Request/Response) to work anywhere TypeScript runs:

    * **Next.js** - Full-stack React with SSR and API routes
    * **Express** - Traditional Node.js web framework
    * **Hono** - Ultrafast edge runtime framework
    * **Bun** - All-in-one JavaScript runtime
    * **Deno** - Secure-by-default runtime

    Same code, same types, different runtime. Choose what works best for your deployment target and switch later if needed—your business logic stays unchanged.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Production Ready">
    Everything you need to build production applications:

    * **Real-time Updates** - Built-in SSE and WebSocket support
    * **Background Jobs** - BullMQ integration for async processing
    * **Caching** - Redis adapter for high-performance caching
    * **Observability** - OpenTelemetry integration out of the box
    * **API Documentation** - Auto-generated OpenAPI specs
    * **Testing** - Server-side caller for fast, type-safe tests

    Start with the core and add features as you scale. No need to retrofit critical functionality later.
